    <h2>THE LAST STRAW BY BOSWORTH CROCKER</h2>
    <p>
        MRS. BAUER. No, Mr. Bauer's out yet. [_She listens through the transmitter._] Thank you, Mrs. Mohler. [_Another pause._] I'll tell him
    just so soon he comes in--yes, ma'am.
    </p>

        [MRS. BAUER _goes back to her ironing. Grocer boy rushes into basement, whistling; he puts down his basket, goes up to_ MRS.
    BAUER'S _door and looks in_.

        LANE. Say--where's the boss?
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>

        LANE. Nothin'. Got a rag 'round here? Dumb-waiter's all wet.... Lot of groceries for Sawyers.

    <p>
        MRS. BAUER. [_Without lifting her eyes, mechanically hands him a mop which hangs beside the door._] Here.
